In this game, players have to whack different types of moles as they appear on the screen. There are three types of moles:

1. **Normal Mole**: The regular mole that appears at a moderate pace.
2. **Fast Mole**: The speedster mole that pops up and disappears quickly.
3. **Armored Mole**: The tough mole that takes more hits to whack.

## 🕹️ Controls
